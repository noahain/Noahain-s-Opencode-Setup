| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Added            | Features                          |

| Security         | Security (subset of Fixes)        |

### Rules

1. Newest version at the top
2. `[Unreleased]` section always present for in-progress changes
3. Dates in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
4. Version links at the bottom comparing tags
5. Entries written in imperative mood ("Add", not "Added" or "Adds")

### Structure

```markdown

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/user/repo/compare/v1.1.0...v1.2.0
```

### Differences from CHANGELOG.md

- Uses emoji prefixes for visual scanning
- More conversational tone
- Includes "Full Changelog" compare link
- May include contributor acknowledgments
- Single release, not cumulative

---

## Announcement Copy

For blog posts, social media, or team communication.

### Structure

````markdown
# {Project} v{X.Y.Z} Released

{One sentence summary of the most important change.}

## Highlights

- **{Top feature}** — {what it means for users, 1-2 sentences}
- **{Second feature}** — {what it means for users}
- **{Important fix}** — {what was broken and is now fixed}

## Breaking Changes

{If any, explain what users need to do to upgrade.}

## Get Started

```bash
pip install project==X.Y.Z
```
````

Full changelog: {link}

```

### Writing Guidelines

- Lead with the most impactful change
- Maximum 3-5 highlights — this is a summary, not the full changelog
- Use benefit-oriented language ("You can now..." not "We implemented...")
- Include upgrade command or link
- Link to full changelog for details
