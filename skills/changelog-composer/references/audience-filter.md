# Audience Filter

Rules for determining whether a change is user-facing or internal-only, and how
to adjust changelog content for different audiences.

---

## Audience Types

| Audience               | What They Care About                      | What to Exclude                            |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| End users              | Features, bug fixes, breaking changes     | Internal refactoring, test changes, CI     |
| Developers (consumers) | API changes, new methods, deprecations    | Internal architecture, test infrastructure |
| Contributors           | Architecture changes, test infrastructure | End-user feature descriptions              |

Default audience is **end users** unless specified otherwise.

## User-Facing Detection

### File-Based Heuristics

| Files Changed                   | Likely User-Facing | Rationale                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `src/**/*.py` (public modules)  | Yes                | Implementation changes may affect behavior |
| `tests/**` only                 | No                 | Tests don't change behavior                |
| `*.md` in root                  | Sometimes          | README changes may document new features   |
| `.github/**`, `ci/**`           | No                 | CI configuration                           |
| `pyproject.toml` (version only) | No                 | Version bump alone isn't newsworthy        |
| `pyproject.toml` (deps)         | Sometimes          | Security-relevant dependency updates       |
| `migrations/**`                 | Sometimes          | Schema changes may indicate features       |
| `docs/**`                       | Sometimes          | New guides indicate new features           |

### Content-Based Heuristics

| Commit Content                     | User-Facing | Rationale                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Modifies public function signature | Yes         | API change                               |
| Adds new public function/class     | Yes         | New capability                           |
| Modifies private/internal function | No          | Implementation detail                    |
| Changes error message text         | Sometimes   | If users see the message                 |
| Modifies configuration schema      | Yes         | Users interact with config               |
| Updates dependency version         | Sometimes   | Only if behavior changes or security fix |

## Exclusion Patterns

### Always Exclude (for end-user changelog)

- Test additions, modifications, or refactoring
- CI/CD pipeline changes
- Code style/formatting changes
- Internal refactoring with no behavior change
- Comment additions or modifications
- Type annotation additions
- Development tool configuration (linters, formatters)
- Lock file updates (unless security-relevant)

### Exclude Unless Significant

- Dependency bumps — include only if:
  - Security vulnerability fixed
  - Major version upgrade with behavior changes
  - New capability enabled
- Refactoring — include only if:
  - Public API surface changed
  - Performance characteristics changed
  - Error messages changed

### Never Exclude

- Breaking changes (regardless of how "minor")
- Security fixes
- Data loss fixes
- Privacy-related changes

## Multi-Audience Strategy

When the same release needs changelogs for different audiences:

### Approach: Layered Changelogs

```markdown
## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-25

### Breaking Changes

{All audiences see this}

### Features

{End users and developers see this}

### Fixes

{End users and developers see this}

### Developer Notes

{Developers and contributors see this — API changes, deprecations}

### Internal

{Contributors only — refactoring, test improvements, CI changes}
```

Use the `--audience` flag (or equivalent) to control which sections appear:

- `user` → Breaking + Features + Fixes
- `developer` → Breaking + Features + Fixes + Developer Notes
- `contributor` → Everything
