# Blog Writing — Before/After Examples

## Example 1: Tech Commentary

**Before (AI-generated):**
> In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, AI-assisted coding tools have emerged as a transformative force in software development. These groundbreaking innovations are reshaping how developers ideate, iterate, and deliver solutions. It's not just about autocomplete; it's about unlocking creativity at scale, fostering collaboration, and enhancing productivity. The future of coding looks incredibly promising, and exciting times lie ahead for the developer community.

**After (humanized):**
> AI coding assistants can make you faster at the boring parts. Not everything. Definitely not architecture.

> They're great at boilerplate: config files, test scaffolding, repetitive refactors. They're also great at sounding right while being wrong. I've accepted suggestions that compiled, passed lint, and still missed the point because I stopped paying attention.

> The productivity claims are slippery. GitHub says Copilot users "accept 30% of suggestions," but acceptance isn't correctness. If you don't have tests, you're guessing.

**Patterns removed:** Significance inflation — "rapidly evolving technological landscape", "transformative force" (1), promotional — "groundbreaking", "incredibly promising" (4), negative parallelism — "It's not just about X; it's about Y" (9), rule of three — "ideate, iterate, and deliver" and "collaboration, and enhancing" (10), generic positive conclusion — "exciting times lie ahead" (24), AI vocabulary — "fostering", "enhancing" (7).

## Example 2: Product Review

**Before (AI-generated):**
> I recently had the opportunity to explore the latest iteration of this remarkable product. The device boasts an impressive array of features, including a stunning display, enhanced battery life, and a powerful processor. The user experience has been significantly improved, showcasing the manufacturer's commitment to innovation and excellence. Overall, this represents a significant step forward for the industry.

**After (humanized):**
> I've been using the new model for two weeks. The screen is noticeably better — brighter outdoors and the colors look less washed out than the previous version. Battery gets me through a full day now, which it didn't before.

> The processor upgrade is harder to feel in daily use. Apps open maybe a half-second faster. I notice it in video editing but not much else.

> It's a solid upgrade if you're on a two-year-old model. If you bought last year's version, probably not worth it.

**Patterns removed:** Promotional language — "remarkable", "impressive", "stunning", "powerful", "excellence" (4), copula avoidance — "boasts" (8), rule of three — "display, battery life, and processor" (10), superficial -ing — "showcasing" (3), generic conclusion — "significant step forward for the industry" (24), AI vocabulary — "enhanced", "commitment to" (7).

## Example 3: Tutorial Introduction

**Before (AI-generated):**
> Welcome to this comprehensive guide on setting up a Python development environment! In this tutorial, we'll delve into the intricacies of virtual environments, package management, and IDE configuration. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your coding journey, this guide will equip you with the essential knowledge to streamline your workflow and enhance your productivity. Let's dive in!

**After (humanized):**
> This guide covers setting up a Python dev environment from scratch: virtual environments, package management with uv, and VS Code configuration. Takes about 20 minutes. Assumes you have Python 3.12+ installed.

**Patterns removed:** Chatbot artifacts — "Welcome to", "Let's dive in!" (19), AI vocabulary — "delve", "intricacies", "comprehensive", "essential", "enhance" (7), promotional — "streamline your workflow and enhance your productivity" (4), false range — "seasoned developer or just starting your coding journey" (12).
