# Statistical Signals of AI-Generated Text

12 distributional signals used by AI-text detection systems. These measure structural regularity, predictability, and distributional patterns that differ between machine-generated and human-written text.

Claude cannot compute most of these metrics numerically. Instead, use the **target behaviors** column during Phase 4 to produce text that falls within human-typical ranges.

| 1   | Perplexity                            | How predictable text is to a language model       | Higher, variable                    | Lower, uniform                    | Use specific/concrete words over high-frequency generic ones. Prefer "the auth module crashed" over "the system encountered an error"              |
| 2   | Burstiness                            | Variance in token predictability across a passage | High variance                       | Low variance                      | Alternate between predictable phrasings and unexpected expressions. Let some sentences be plain, others surprising                                 |
| 3   | Sentence length variance              | Standard deviation of words per sentence          | SD 7-15 words                       | Narrow SD                         | Mix sentences from 3-8 words to 20-30 words within paragraphs. No three consecutive sentences within 5 words of each other                         |
| 4   | Token probability distribution        | Distribution of word likelihood scores            | Long tail of low-probability tokens | Clustered mid-to-high probability | Include specific nouns, unusual adjectives, domain jargon, and concrete details that a generic model would not predict                             |
| 5   | Type-token ratio                      | Unique words / total words                        | 0.45-0.65                           | Often lower (repetitive)          | Maintain vocabulary breadth through restructuring (pronouns, sentence merging), not synonym cycling                                                |
| 6   | N-gram frequency                      | Distribution of common word sequences             | More rare bigrams/trigrams          | Heavy reliance on stock phrases   | Break phrase templates: "plays a role in" -> name the action. "In terms of" -> delete. "It is worth noting" -> delete                              |
| 7   | Sentence entropy                      | Information density per sentence                  | Moderate to high, variable          | Moderate but uniform              | Vary density: some sentences carry 3-4 facts, others carry one reaction or pivot. Do not distribute information evenly                             |
| 8   | Function word distribution            | Usage patterns of the/and/but/because/however     | Personalized, consistent per author | Standardized, textbook-like       | Develop preferences within a piece: favor "but" over "however", use "still" or "and yet" instead of always defaulting to the same connector        |
| 9   | Clause density                        | Average clauses per sentence                      | 1.2-2.5, varied                     | More uniform                      | Mix simple sentences (one clause) with compound-complex (2-3 clauses). Do not write 10 consecutive simple sentences or 10 consecutive complex ones |
| 10  | Semantic similarity between sentences | Cosine similarity of adjacent sentence embeddings | 0.3-0.6                             | Often higher (tightly related)    | Allow topic micro-shifts: a brief aside, a contextual expansion, a perspective shift. Not every sentence must directly continue the previous one   |
| 11  | Transition phrase frequency           | Discourse markers per 1,000 words                 | 3-8                                 | Often higher                      | Remove 60-80% of formal transitions. Replace half with nothing, the rest with short conjunctions (but, so, still) or paragraph breaks              |
| 12  | Structural symmetry                   | Uniformity of sentence/paragraph/clause patterns  | High irregularity                   | Balanced, mirror-like             | Break symmetry: unequal paragraph lengths, varied sentence openings, mixed clause structures. Avoid A-B-A-B patterns                               |

## Applying Signals by Phase

### Phase 1 (Detection): What to scan for

Assess the input text for these regularity indicators:

- **Sentence length uniformity**: Are most sentences within a 5-word range of each other? Flag if yes.
- **Clause density uniformity**: Does every sentence have the same structure (all simple, or all compound)? Flag if yes.
- **Transition overuse**: Count formal transitions (however, furthermore, additionally, moreover, in addition, therefore, consequently, nevertheless). Flag if above ~8 per 1,000 words.
- **Phrase template density**: Are stock collocations repeated? ("plays a role", "it is important to note", "in terms of", "serves as a", "a wide range of"). Flag clusters.
- **Structural symmetry**: Are paragraphs roughly equal length? Do sentences follow predictable patterns? Flag visible uniformity.
- **Inter-sentence tightness**: Does every sentence directly continue the previous with no shifts, asides, or expansions? Flag if the text reads as a single unbroken logical chain.

### Phase 4 (Entropy): What to target

Use the human-typical ranges as guidelines, not formulas:

**Sentence-level targets:**

- In any 5-sentence window: at least one under 8 words, at least one over 20 words
- No three consecutive sentences with the same clause structure
- At least one sentence per paragraph that shifts density (heavy detail -> light reaction, or vice versa)

**Paragraph-level targets:**

- Visible length variation across paragraphs (some 1-2 sentences, some 4-6)
- At least one paragraph break that is not preceded by a transition phrase

**Document-level targets:**

- 2-3 small topic micro-shifts or asides per 500 words (brief digressions that a thinking human would include)
- Function word preferences should be roughly consistent within the piece (if you use "but" early, don't switch to "however" later without reason)
- Formal transition count under 8 per 1,000 words

## Signals Claude Cannot Directly Compute

These require language model inference or embedding computation that is not available during skill execution:

| Signal                         | Why it's not computable                       | Proxy behavior                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Perplexity (absolute score)    | Requires running a reference LM on the output | Use specific, concrete, domain-appropriate vocabulary instead of generic high-frequency words                     |
| Token probability distribution | Requires token-level probability access       | Include proper nouns, precise numbers, domain jargon — tokens a model would assign low probability                |
| Semantic similarity (cosine)   | Requires sentence embeddings                  | Introduce visible topic variation: asides, perspective shifts, contextual jumps                                   |
| N-gram rarity scores           | Requires corpus frequency data                | Break stock phrases, use fresh constructions, avoid "plays a role in / wide range of / it is important" templates |

The proxy behaviors achieve the same _effect_ on detector scores without requiring numerical computation.
